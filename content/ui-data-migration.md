Hypi supports the migration of data from one instance to another instance. You may further change the data types of fields or add new fields with data migration support. Migration makes data available from one instance to the other.

1. Click on the `Data` tab of the new instance in which data needs to be migrated. You can find the `Migration` tab there. Click on `+New Migration` to start data migration.
