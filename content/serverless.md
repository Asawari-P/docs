Serverless technology is a means of adding custom behaviour without having to worry too much about infrastructure, deployment, or maintenance. Serverless functions are single-purpose, programmatic functions that are hosted by cloud computing platforms.

You may access serverless functions from the Hypi platform. You need to have a docker image of the function created on the platform like [OpenWhisk](https://openwhisk.apache.org/).

> How to set up and use Serverless?

Steps are as follow:

1. [OpenWhisk CLI](openwhisk-cli.md)
2. [Create Serverless Function](create-serverless.md)
3. [Use Serverless Function](use-serverless.md)
4. [Set Permissions](#)

If you need to implement advanced functionalities like Webhooks, Workflows, REST APIs, and Triggers using serverless technology, you can do it as well!
