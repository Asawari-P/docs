Serverless technology is a means of adding custom behaviour without having to worry too much about infrastructure, deployment, or maintenance. Serverless functions are single-purpose, programmatic functions that are hosted by cloud computing platforms.

You may access serverless functions from the Hypi platform. You need to have a docker image of the function created on the platform like [OpenWhisk](https://openwhisk.apache.org/).
