**Aggregation:** Performs a calculation on a set of values and returns a single value  

**API:** Application Programming Interface - a software intermediary that allows two applications to talk to each other.  

**App:** The building block that gets deployed in the client application. It covers all the functionalities to be implemented using Hypi.  

**Authentication:** Verifies the identity of a user.  

**Authorisation Token:** Issued by the server to authenticate requests from the client  

**Authorisation:** Process of specifying access/ rights/ privileges to various resources. It provides
information security and computer security to systems.  

**CRUD:** Commonly used for Create, Read, Update, Delete operations  

**Dependency:** A set of dependent programs that an application relies on  

**Directive:** Decorates part of a GraphQL schema or operation with additional configuration  

**Endpoint:** A URL that represents an object or collection of objects within the domain.  

**Environment:** A system that provides support for the development, repair, and enhancement of software  

**GraphQL:** A query language for APIs and a runtime for fulfilling those queries with the existing data  

**Groovy:** Java-syntax-compatible object-oriented programming language for the Java platform. It is both a static and dynamic language with features similar to those of Python, Ruby, and Smalltalk.  

**HTTP header:** Contains information about the HTTP request context so that the server can tailor the response.

**hypi.id:** Unique identification of an object of any type.  

**Instance:** An isolated copy of the app. Data created in one instance is not accessible by default from another instance. A release may have one or more instances.  

**Interface:** An abstract type with common declared fields.  Any type that implements an interface must define all the fields with names and types exactly matching  

**JSON:** Stands for JavaScript Object Notation. It is a lightweight format for storing and transporting data.  

**Mutation:** Operation to create, update, or delete data from the database  

**Object:** The most basic components of a GraphQL schema. It contains a collection of fields of different types.  

**Query:** Retrieve data from the database  
  
**Reference:** Shares data among various data types  

**Release:** Represents the version of the app. Different releases can be created for various stages of the Software Development Life Cycle.

**Schema:** The way of defining a data model using Graph QL. Different tables, objects can be added to the schema.

**Serverless function:** Single purpose, programmatic functions that are hosted by cloud computing platforms.

**Subscription:** Creates access to any field of the data type and monitors the data insertion operation to the field.

**Trigger:** Function that is executed before or after an event has happened.

**type:** Represents a table-like structure

**User Defined Function:** Way to implement custom behavior outside of available APIs

**Velocity:** Java-based templating engine

**Workflow:** Handles sequential events.
